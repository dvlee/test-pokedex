# test-pokedex

Test task for a Frontend developer vacancy in Asakabank

# Introduction

Please create a simple application with the list of pokemons (pokedex).
Requirements
You have to meet the following requirements:

1. Source code should be open sourced on GitHub
2. The design of the app is not important, but the overall user experience and usability of the application should be good. You can use the existing UI libraries like material ui or ant.design
3. Application should be responsive (look good both on mobile and desktop)
4. Code should be formatted by prettier and linted by eslint.
5. The application should be deployed online. Heroku, github pages are a few of free alternatives for deployment
6. The app must be developed with React.js and Redux (feel free to use RTK) in ES6.

# Evaluation Criterias

We do not expect to receive a production ready application from you, but it’s important for us to understand whether you have the following skills:

1. Deliver a minimal viable product in a short period of time
2. Follow good coding conventions and style guides
3. Know what is important to implement, and what can be left out to be implemented in future
4. Ability to properly integrate libraries into the app and use them
5. ... more stuff depending on your skill level (DRY, architecture skills, etc.)

# Bonuses

Following are not a requirement, but will be a bonus for us:

1. Use functional components with hooks. For redux prefer hooks usage as well
2. SASS, Stylus or any UI library (AntD, MaterialUI, etc)
3. Webpack if applicable
4. CSS animations
5. Unit testing

# Pokedex

Using the open pokemon API (http://pokeapi.co/ \*) build a pokedex with the following functionality:

# Front End Candidate Requirements:

1. List pokemons in a table view (or cards) with their name, avatar, type (should visually look as a colored tag) and the main pokemon stats (whichever additional pokemon info you want to show)
2. When you click on a pokemon in the list, some additional detailed information should be
   shown (for example in a modal dialog).
3. The list must have a pagination with an ability to select how many items to show per page (10 / 20 / 50)
4. Filter the pokemons by name with a search box
5. Filter the pokemons by type using tags (multiple selected tags have to show pokemons with any of the types selected)
6. \*\* Show your skills

\*\* Show your skills, In addition to the requirements above you can implement anything you want using the API if you want to demonstrate more of your skills

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
